        1. Website Visitors
      </h1>
      <br />
      <p>Like most website operators, Urban cart collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as 
        the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Urban cart's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying 
        information is to better understand how Urban cart's visitors use its website. From time to time, Urban cart may release non-personally-identifying information in 
        the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Urban cart also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments 
        on https://urbancartt.netlify.app/ blog posts. Urban cart only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
        and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        2. Personally-Identifying Information
      </h1>
      <br />
      <p>Certain visitors to Urban cart's websites choose to interact with Urban cart in ways that require Urban cart to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Urban cart gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://urbancartt.netlify.app/ to provide a username and email address.</p>

Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>

      <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>
